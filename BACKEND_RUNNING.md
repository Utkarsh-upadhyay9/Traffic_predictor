# ‚úÖ BACKEND IS NOW RUNNING!

## Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Backend API running on: **http://localhost:8000**
- ‚úÖ API Docs available at: **http://localhost:8000/docs**
- ‚úÖ Frontend open in browser: **index.html**

---

## üéØ Quick Test:

### 1. Backend Health Check:
Open in browser: http://localhost:8000/health

Should see:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  ...
}
```

### 2. API Documentation:
Open in browser: http://localhost:8000/docs
- You'll see all available endpoints
- You can test them interactively

### 3. Test a Prediction:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Click anywhere on the map (try Dallas/Fort Worth area)
3. Select time: **8:00 AM**
4. Select day: **Monday**
5. Click **"Predict Traffic"**
6. Should show: **~75% congestion** (RED - morning rush hour)

## üêõ If You See "Failed to fetch":

### Solution 1: Restart Backend
```powershell
# Kill all Python processes
taskkill /F /IM python.exe

# Start backend in new window
Start-Process cmd -ArgumentList "/k cd C:\Users\utkar\Desktop\Xapps\Digi_sim\backend && python main.py"

# Wait 15 seconds
timeout /t 15

# Test
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Solution 2: Check Port 8000
```powershell
# See what's using port 8000
netstat -ano | findstr :8000

# Kill the process (replace <PID> with number from above)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

### Solution 3: Use the Batch File
```powershell
# Double-click this file:
start_backend.bat

# Keep the CMD window OPEN
```

---

## üìù Common Issues:

### "ModuleNotFoundError"
```powershell
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Port 8000 already in use"
```powershell
# Kill all Python
taskkill /F /IM python.exe

# Then restart
```

### "CORS Error in browser"
- This is normal, backend allows all origins
- Just refresh the page

### "Backend keeps closing"
- Make sure the CMD window stays OPEN
- Don't close it!
- The server runs as long as that window is open

## üéâ Success Checklist:

- [x] Backend running on port 8000
- [x] Frontend opens in browser
- [x] Map loads (Mapbox)
- [x] Can click to select location
- [x] Time/date pickers work
- [x] "Predict Traffic" button functional
- [x] Predictions show realistic congestion values
- [x] Colors match Google Maps (RED for heavy, GREEN for light)

## üí° Pro Tips:

1. **Keep CMD window open** - Server runs as long as window is open
2. **Test different times** - See how congestion changes throughout the day
3. **Compare weekday vs weekend** - Weekend traffic is 40% lighter
4. **Try holidays** - Even lighter traffic (60% of normal)
5. **Check API docs** - http://localhost:8000/docs for all endpoints
