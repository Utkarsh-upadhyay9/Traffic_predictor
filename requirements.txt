# NOTE: Build was failing trying to compile pydantic-core (Rust/maturin)
# because the platform used Python 3.13 and fell back to source build.
# We avoid that entirely by pinning to FastAPI version that uses
# Pydantic v1 (pure Python, no pydantic-core dependency).

# FastAPI version compatible with Pydantic 1.x
fastapi==0.103.2          # Last releases before mandatory Pydantic v2

# Pydantic v1 (pure Python, no Rust build)
pydantic==1.10.13

# ASGI server (pure wheel)
uvicorn==0.22.0           # Stable with FastAPI 0.103.x

# Env & HTTP utilities
python-dotenv==1.0.0
requests==2.31.0
python-dateutil==2.8.2

# (Intentionally no numpy / pandas / torch / scikit-learn)
# All ML functionality gracefully degrades to pattern-based logic.

# If later you restore DL models on a machine that supports wheels:
#   torch==2.1.2
#   scikit-learn==1.3.2
# Add ONLY when not on constrained build environments.
