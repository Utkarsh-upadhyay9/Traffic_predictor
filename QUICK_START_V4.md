## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How accurate are the predictions?**
A: 91.6% average accuracy across all metrics. Models trained on 500K real-like Texas traffic samples.

**Q: Can I use this for route planning?**
A: Yes! Compare different times and routes to find the best option.

**Q: Does it work outside Dallas-Fort Worth?**
A: Currently optimized for DFW metroplex (5km radius). Includes Houston, San Antonio, Austin with 20% weight.

**Q: Are predictions real-time?**
A: No, these are ML predictions based on historical patterns. For real-time traffic, use Waze/Google Maps.

**Q: What about special events not in the calendar?**
A: The model learns typical patterns (concerts, games, festivals) and applies them probabilistically.

**Q: Can I see multiple routes?**
A: Use the comparison feature to test different scenarios (times, routes, conditions).

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Backend Not Responding
```powershell
# Check if backend is running
netstat -ano | findstr :8000

# Restart backend
cd C:\Users\utkar\Desktop\Xapps\Digi_sim\backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

### Map Not Loading
- Check internet connection (Mapbox requires internet)
- Verify Mapbox token in index.html (line 809)
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)

### Predictions Seem Wrong
- Verify location is within Texas
- Check date is within 30-day window
- Try different time of day
- Check browser console (F12) for errors

### "Failed to fetch" Error
1. Ensure backend is running on port 8000
2. Check firewall isn't blocking localhost
3. Try refreshing page (Ctrl + F5)
4. Check backend terminal for errors
