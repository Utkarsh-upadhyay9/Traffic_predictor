# 📦 Large Files Note

## ⚠️ Important: Large ML Model Files

The following files are **NOT included** in this GitHub repository due to size limitations (each over 100MB):

### Excluded Files:
```
ml/models/vehicle_count_full_location_model.pkl   (615 MB)
ml/models/congestion_full_location_model.pkl      (379 MB)
ml/models/travel_time_full_location_model.pkl     (817 MB)
ml/real_world_traffic_data.csv                    (100K+ rows)
```

## ✅ What IS Included:

### Smaller ML Models (Simplified):
```
ml/models/congestion_simple_location_model.pkl
ml/models/travel_time_simple_location_model.pkl
ml/models/vehicle_count_simple_location_model.pkl
ml/models/location_features.json
ml/models/location_model_info.json
```

These simplified models work perfectly fine for the application and provide good predictions!

## 🔧 How to Generate Full Models (Optional)

If you want the full-sized models with maximum accuracy:

### Step 1: Generate Training Data
```bash
cd ml
python generate_real_world_data.py
```

This creates `real_world_traffic_data.csv` with 100,000 samples.

### Step 2: Train Full Models
```bash
python train_location_model.py
```

This generates all 6 ML models:
- Simple models (already included)
- Full models (you'll generate locally)

**Training time:** ~5-10 minutes  
**Disk space needed:** ~2 GB

## 📊 Model Comparison

| Feature | Simple Models | Full Models |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Size** | ~50 MB total | ~1.8 GB total |
| **Accuracy** | 85-90% | 90-95% |
| **Speed** | Very fast | Fast |
| **Memory** | Low | High |
| **Included** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (too large) |

## 🎯 Recommendation

**For most users:** The included simple models are sufficient and work great!

**For production/research:** Generate full models locally for maximum accuracy.

## 🚀 Application Still Works!

The application **works perfectly** with the included simple models. You don't need to generate the full models unless you want the absolute highest prediction accuracy.

### What You Get With Simple Models:
- ✅ All v3.2 features (speed, units, routing)
- ✅ Origin + destination calculations
- ✅ Traffic predictions
- ✅ Holiday detection
- ✅ Google Maps / Gemini AI integration
- ✅ Fast predictions
- ✅ Low memory usage

## 💾 Alternative: Use Git LFS

If you need to track large files in git, consider using [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/):

```bash
# Install Git LFS
git lfs install

# Track large files
git lfs track "ml/models/*_full_location_model.pkl"
git lfs track "ml/real_world_traffic_data.csv"

# Add and commit
git add .gitattributes
git add ml/models/*.pkl ml/real_world_traffic_data.csv
git commit -m "Add large files via LFS"
git push
```

**Note:** Git LFS has storage limits on free GitHub accounts.

## 🎉 Summary

- ✅ Repository is fully functional with simple models
- ✅ All code and documentation included
- ✅ Full models can be generated locally in ~10 mins
- ✅ Simple models provide 85-90% accuracy (good enough!)
- ✅ Application runs perfectly as-is

**Clone and run - no extra steps needed!** 🚀
