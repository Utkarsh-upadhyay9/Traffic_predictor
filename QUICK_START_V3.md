## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why can't I select past dates?**  
A: The system only predicts future traffic. Historical data is used for training, not querying.

**Q: Why only 30 days ahead?**  
A: Weather and events beyond 30 days are highly uncertain. Predictions would be unreliable.

**Q: Are predictions real-time?**  
A: No, these are predictions based on historical patterns. For real-time data, use Waze or Google Maps.

**Q: How accurate are the predictions?**  
A: 
- Congestion: 94-98% accurate (R² score)
- Travel time: 82-95% accurate
- Vehicle count: 96-98% accurate

**Q: What if there's an accident?**  
A: The model accounts for typical accident rates (12% of samples include incidents), but cannot predict specific future accidents.

**Q: Does it work for other cities?**  
A: Currently trained only for UT Arlington area (5km radius). For other cities, retrain with local data.

**Q: Can I use this for route planning?**  
A: Yes! Compare traffic at different times and locations to find the best route.

**Q: Why does the holiday indicator sometimes not appear?**  
A: Only appears if the selected date is a recognized holiday. Check `/api/holidays` endpoint for full list.
