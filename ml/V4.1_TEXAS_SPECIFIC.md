## üìä Data Distribution

**Training data now weighted for Texas:**

```
DFW Metroplex: 70% (Dallas, Arlington, Fort Worth, suburbs)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dallas: 25%
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Arlington: 20%

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Suburbs: 10% (Plano, Frisco, Irving, etc.)

Major TX Cities: 20% (Houston, San Antonio, Austin)

Other TX Cities: 10% (El Paso, Corpus Christi, Lubbock)
```

This ensures models are **optimized for DFW** while maintaining coverage across Texas.

## üìà Expected Improvements

### Accuracy Gains from Texas-Specific Training:

| Metric | Before (Global) | After (Texas) | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| DFW Area Accuracy | 82-86% | 88-92% | +6-7% |
| Event Prediction | Generic | Texas-specific | Much better |
| Highway Congestion | Approximate | TX highways | Much better |
| Weather Impact | Generic | North TX climate | More accurate |
| Local Knowledge | None | 33+ landmarks | Significantly better |

### Why Texas-Specific is Better:

1. **Local Patterns**: Dallas drivers behave differently than NYC drivers
2. **Texas Events**: Cowboys games ‚â† generic sports games (3.5x vs 2.5x traffic)
3. **Texas Highways**: Frontage roads, toll roads, unique interchanges
4. **Texas Weather**: North Texas heat, thunderstorms, rare ice/snow
5. **Texas Culture**: Driving behaviors, commute patterns, event attendance

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate:

1. ‚úÖ Texas-specific data collection (DONE)
2. ‚è≥ Generate 100K Texas samples (Ready to run)
3. ‚è≥ Train models on Texas data (Ready to run)
4. ‚è≥ Deploy Texas-trained models to backend

### Future Enhancements:

- **TxDOT Integration**: Real-time traffic from Texas DOT
- **DART Data**: Dallas Area Rapid Transit schedules
- **Trinity Metro**: Fort Worth public transit
- **Texas Toll Roads**: NTTA, TxTag data
- **Additional Events**: Texas Motor Speedway, Fort Worth Stock Show & Rodeo
